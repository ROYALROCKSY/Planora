Buckets are 15 minutes. Sessions increment all buckets they touch.

We try window sizes 30m / 45m / 60m / 90m / 120m and pick the window with the highest density (average bucket count). Tie-breaker prefers windows with greater absolute sum, then smaller window (more precise).

We handle wrap-around by duplicating the buckets array (so windows crossing midnight are considered).

If <15 sessions found, we return the user's stored preferred_time (or fall back to qna.morning_evening_person mapping).

Uses your get_db() connection and converts user_id to ObjectId for fetching the user document (sessions are queried by the string id as your generator populated them).

1. Fetch User and Sessions
user_obj = db.users.find_one({"_id": ObjectId(user_id)})
sessions_cursor = db.sessions.find({"user_id": user_id}).sort("start_time", -1).limit(MAX_SESSIONS_TO_FETCH)
sessions = list(sessions_cursor)


The function first fetches the user object from the users collection using the user_id.

Then it fetches the most recent sessions (up to MAX_SESSIONS_TO_FETCH, say 30) from the sessions collection.

Sorting is done in descending order of start_time so the most recent sessions are first.

Fallback:
If the user has less than 15 sessions, the function simply returns the user’s preferred study time from the QnA, because there isn’t enough data to compute a meaningful best time.

2. Convert Sessions to Buckets

The day is divided into 15-minute intervals, giving 96 buckets for 24 hours:

buckets = [0] * 96


Each bucket represents 15 minutes (0:00–0:15, 0:15–0:30, … 23:45–0:00).

_add_session_to_buckets(start, end, buckets) increments the count in all buckets touched by a session.

For example, a session from 5:45 PM to 6:30 PM will increment the counts in buckets corresponding to 17:45–18:00, 18:00–18:15, 18:15–18:30.

This effectively creates a heatmap of user activity across the day.

3. Extend the Buckets Array
extended = buckets + buckets


This is done to handle wrap-around.

Example: if the user studies 11 PM to 1 AM, the window spans midnight. Doubling the array lets us slide a window across midnight without special handling.

4. Sliding Window to Find Best Time
for w in WINDOW_BUCKET_OPTIONS:
    for start in range(0, 96):
        window_sum = sum(extended[start:start+w])
        density = window_sum / float(w)
        ...


WINDOW_BUCKET_OPTIONS = candidate window sizes (number of buckets, e.g., 8 buckets = 2 hours).

For each window size and each possible start index, we calculate:

window_sum = total sessions in that window

density = average activity per bucket (higher density = more consistent study in that window)

Keep track of the best window by comparing (density, window_sum, -window_size) lexicographically.

This ensures we prefer highly concentrated sessions, tie-break by total activity, and prefer smaller windows for precision.

5. Convert Bucket Index to Time
start_min = best_start_idx * 15
end_min = start_min + best_w * 15
start_str = _format_time_from_minutes(start_min)
end_str = _format_time_from_minutes(end_min % (24*60))


best_start_idx → starting bucket index of the best window

best_w → width of the window in buckets

Convert bucket index to minutes of the day, then to 12-hour formatted string for display.

6. Return the Best Time Range
return {"best_time": f"{start_str} to {end_str}"}


This gives a range like "5:00 PM to 7:00 PM".

Max window width is 2 hours (by design of WINDOW_BUCKET_OPTIONS).

If no sessions were available, fallback to user preference.

Summary of the Logic

Fetch user and most recent 15–30 study sessions.

Divide the day into 15-min buckets and mark session activity.

Slide 2-hour windows over the buckets to find the most frequent and dense study period.

Convert the bucket range into a human-readable 12-hour time string.

Return as the “best time to study” for that user.

✅ Why it works

Handles any start/end times, even irregular like 5:43–6:12 PM.

Can cross midnight without issues.

Uses recent sessions (up to 30) for a robust calculation.

Falls back to user QnA if there’s insufficient history.





3️⃣ How Auth Will Work Later

With Flask-Login or JWT:

When a user logs in, the backend sets a session cookie or returns a JWT token.

Each request to /cards/best-time will carry the token automatically (header or cookie).

Backend extraction:

Instead of getting user_id from query params:

from flask_login import current_user

user_id = current_user.id


Or with JWT:

user_id = get_user_id_from_token(request.headers.get("Authorization"))


Frontend stays clean:

You don’t need to pass user_id manually in the URL or JS.

The JS just fetches /cards/best-time without query params.
